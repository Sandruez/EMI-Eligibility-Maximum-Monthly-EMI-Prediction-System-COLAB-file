The project addresses the growing issue of EMI defaults caused by poor risk assessment by developing a data-driven platform capable of predicting EMI eligibility and estimating the maximum affordable EMI for individuals.\n","\n","Built using a dataset of 400,000 financial records with 22 demographic and economic variables, the system performs dual ML tasks—a classification model for EMI eligibility prediction and a regression model for maximum EMI amount estimation. Extensive feature engineering was applied to derive meaningful attributes such as credit utilization ratio, EMI-to-income ratio, and financial health score, improving the interpretability and performance of the models.\n","\n","The platform leverages MLflow for experiment tracking and model comparison, ensuring efficient management of model versions, hyperparameters, and metrics. This integration enables reproducible experimentation and streamlined model optimization. A range of algorithms—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression—were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), and R² to ensure robust predictive capability.\n","\n","To make the solution accessible and interactive, a Streamlit-based web application was developed. Users can input personal and financial data to instantly view EMI eligibility results, estimated EMI limits, and visual insights into their financial health. The system also includes CRUD functionalities for managing financial records, enabling seamless data updates and historical tracking.\n","\n","Deployed on Streamlit Cloud, the platform offers a production-ready, scalable, and user-friendly interface for real-time financial risk assessment.\n","\n","⚓ Overall, this project demonstrates how machine learning, model tracking, and web technologies can be integrated into a comprehensive FinTech solution. It not only showcases technical expertise in end-to-end ML development but also delivers practical impact by helping individuals and financial institutions make smarter, data-driven loan decisions."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/Sandruez/EMI-Eligibility-Maximum-Monthly-EMI-Prediction-System.git"],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Mlflow Analysis Link:-"],"metadata":{"id":"z06zY20fEwSM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://dagshub.com/chandrapapr1501/MLflow-model-tracking.mlflow/#/compare-experiments/s?experiments=%5B%223%22%2C%224%22%2C%225%22%2C%226%22%5D&searchFilter=&orderByKey=attributes.start_time&orderByAsc=false&startTime=ALL&lifecycleFilter=Active&modelVersionFilter=All+Runs&datasetsFilter=W10%3D"],"metadata":{"id":"uIQuEG6VE2SQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Streamlit App Link:"],"metadata":{"id":"R64vLopcFDlx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://emi-insights-app.streamlit.app/"],"metadata":{"id":"z50bSbCUFMSn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"b_CB9ILLEvJF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<u>Problem Statement</u>\n","\n","In the modern financial ecosystem, individuals frequently face difficulties in managing their EMIs (Equated Monthly Instalments) due to inadequate financial planning and insufficient risk assessment.
